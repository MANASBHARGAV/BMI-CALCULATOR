# BMI-CALCULATOR
BMI is a calculated measure of a person's body weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of their height (in meters). Although BMI does not directly measure body fat, BMI is moderately to strongly associated with other measures that capture the amount, location, and distribution of body fat.
